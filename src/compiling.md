# Compiling Our Code

In previous chapter we learned how to write an hello world application and ran it in the page.

Now its time to actually be able to run it on our computer.

Rust is a compiled language. Which means before being able to run our code we are supposed to be able to compile it first.
Compiling is the way of translating our code into the instructions that target platform understands.
