# Rust Programming Language

## Welcome 

Welcome to Rust journey.
Rust is a low level systems programming language with a very nice to use standard library.

In this book we will cover topics like:

- Rust syntax
- What makes Rust different (memory safety, backwards compatibility promise etc.)
- Rust unique way of protecting us against ourselves through the idea of ownership.

And many others ...

## Format of this book

We will be learning things by making mistakes and getting our hands dirty. 
There are runnable examples in the book which you can edit and play around.
In addition, often I will add links to [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

## Why not to just go with [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

The official book is amazing if you are already familiar with the concepts however, it can be frustrating if you are coming from high level scripting languages or if Rust is your first programming language.
